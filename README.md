## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The primary objective of this dashboard is to rigorously model, measure, analyze, and continually monitor the sales performance within the furniture department store. By harnessing the insights extracted from the accessible Orders, People, and Returns datasets, the dashboard facilitates a comprehensive understanding of sales and orders. Through the implementation of predefined dimensions and key performance indicators, it generates three distinctive analyses: sales summary, product detail, and customer detail. These analyses are thoughtfully designed to address the specific information requirements of diverse stakeholders, empowering them with actionable insights to drive data-informed decisions and optimize the furniture department store's performance.
